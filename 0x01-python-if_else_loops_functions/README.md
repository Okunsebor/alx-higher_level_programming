Tasks
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and print whether the number is positive or negative.
1. The last digit
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and print whether the last digit is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
This program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
This function checks for uppercase and lowercase letters in a string.
4. Hexadecimal printing
This program prints all the numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
5. 00...99
This program prints all numbers from 0 to 99.
6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
This function prints a string n number of times.
7. islower
This function checks for lowercase characters in a string.
8. To uppercase
This function prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
This function prints the last digit of a number.
10. a + b
This function adds two integers and returns the result.
11. a ^ b
This function computes the power of one number to another.
12. Fizz Buzz
This program prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
For multiples of three, it prints Fizz instead of the number.
For multiples of five, it prints Buzz.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints FizzBuzz.
13. Insert in sorted linked list
This function inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
